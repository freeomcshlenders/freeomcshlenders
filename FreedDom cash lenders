For the past two years, the economy has really taken us for a ride. The stock market has been way up and way down, bringing more volatility than most people are comfortable with. Unemployment rates are at highs most of us have never seen before. The economic crisis is hurting families at all economic levels.

Now it is more critical than ever to be careful with your finances. Eliminating debt requires both consistency and determination. It can be tempting to seek ways to speed up the process. Some people consider taking out a loan to pay off credit cards. However, today, I want to share one money mistake that you should really avoid.
